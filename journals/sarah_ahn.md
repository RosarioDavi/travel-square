- the team discussed whether we should put Accounts in its own microservice. We concluded that we'd like to consult Dalonte for this tomorrow. We also discussed whether we should use Postgres or MongoDB, and we are leaning towards Postgres
- reviewed exploration materials for user stories and created a Trello workspace for Travel Squared that contains the user stories, bug tracker, and stand-up board we'll use daily. Each board has a sample post in case someone isn't sure what to write. I plan to review all of the boards and receive feedback from the team tomorrow
