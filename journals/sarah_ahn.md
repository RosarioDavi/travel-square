- the team moved forward with MongoDB, and we split up the queries and routers files. We spent the day filling out our files while Muhammad set up models.py
- I'm still getting more familiarized with Mongo and Postres, but I think I'm getting the hang of git in a group setting
- Muhammad mentioned that we may need to go back to Postres so we will visit that tomorrow

11/16/22
- reviewed the Trello workspace with the team, and everyone agreed to use it for project management
- the team chose to use Postres but after further discussion we may go with MongoDB. We will consult an instructor tomorrow regarding this
- we worked on mapping out the models in Excalidraw and then created SQL tables based on those models
- need to learn more about MongoDB tonight

11/15/22
- the team discussed whether we should put Accounts in its own microservice. We concluded that we'd like to consult Dalonte for this tomorrow. We also discussed whether we should use Postgres or MongoDB, and we are leaning towards Postgres
- reviewed exploration materials for user stories and created a Trello workspace for Travel Squared that contains the user stories, bug tracker, and stand-up board we'll use daily. Each board has a sample post in case someone isn't sure what to write. I plan to review all of the boards and receive feedback from the team tomorrow

11/14/22
- in the D5 exploration, learned about user stories, Agile methodologies, and bug tracking
- reviewed our previous night's exploration on FastAPI
- tomorrow, we should agree on a project management system with bug tracking and how to prioritize our work
- last Thursday, I pushed my updates to doc/api-design.md
