Today we worked on finishing up the exploration on databases and FastAPI.
We have a solid understanding of what core features our application rely on.
We will continue to brush up on FastAPI in preparation for beginning our code
tomorrow. I really look forward to seeing how we break down our accounts microserice.

We're getting a better understanding of what tables our data will rely on. We are considering using the accounts feature as part of the main backend microservice instead of polling AccountVOs from a separate accounts microservice. The issue is understanding how we can assign users to their account profiles. We plan on going through more of the explorations, especially on authentication, and look into the Books demo project to see how accounts and roles were implemented.
