We started off stand up today going over trello and how we will use it to keep track of our developments and bugs that needs to be worked on. We decided with the help of Dalonte that we will just have two microservices: the frontend react and backend database. For our database, we first mapped out the models on Excalidraw and divided the creation of the tables using postgres SQL. We will review MongoDB's exploration tonight to see whether Postgres or MongoDB is more suitable for our project.

Today I created the Docker yaml file, relational-data directory and the fastAPI directory for the accounts. I was able to run the docker container with ports and pgAdmin successfully. Tomorrow during stand up I will share the updates with the team and discuss how many databases and microservices we would like to have.

Today we spent time reviewing the FastAPI and database explorations to solidify our understanding. I am re-reading and following along the exploration tutorial again to better my understanding of fastAPI. We will continue to work on our endpoints and think of how we can apply fastAPI to our project. I look forwards to start coding and building our project after the lecture on fastAPI tomorrow!
