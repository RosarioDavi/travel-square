Today we spent time reviewing the FastAPI and database explorations to solidify our understanding. I am re-reading and following along the exploration tutorial again to better my understanding of fastAPI. We will continue to work on our endpoints and think of how we can apply fastAPI to our project. I look forwards to start coding and building our project after the lecture on fastAPI tomorrow!

Today I created the Docker yaml file, relational-data directory and the fastAPI directory for the accounts. I was able to run the docker container with ports and pgAdmin successfully. Tomorrow during stand up I will share the updates with the team and discuss how many databases and microservices we would like to have.
