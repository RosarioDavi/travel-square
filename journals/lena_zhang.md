Today we spent time reviewing the FastAPI and database explorations to solidify our understanding. I am re-reading and following along the exploration tutorial again to better my understanding of fastAPI. We will continue to work on our endpoints and think of how we can apply fastAPI to our project. I look forwards to start coding and building our project after the lecture on fastAPI tomorrow!
