Today the team decided to review the Fast API exploration. I reread the exploration pages and went along with watching the videos. I believe the team will continue to review and prepare for tomorrows lecture. We plan on starting to code and build our website tomorrow once the API lecture is over.

Today was a slower start for me personally. My team worked on differnt things to try and move foward with the project. I went over some more fast api videos, specfically the one about creating models. It sure makes me wish Django was allowed to be used. Overall my team did well and progressed foward, creating a Trello workspace.
