Today the team decided to switch from mongodb to postgress. This decission was made because we realized it would be easier to move foward in sql then mongo. After converting everything and making sure docker containers were running, we split some code up the same as we did yesterday. I was in charge of recoding venues queries and routers. I went back to the fastAPI videos to code along and follow. I was able to complete the venue.py routers. Currently still working on queries.

Today we started to code. I was in charge of working on the venue.py in queries and in routers. I was using the mongo-api-examples and following the books.py examples. I was having issues merging and comitting to git, I reached out to the seirs and the solution took about an hour to resolve. I was able to commit my venue.py to main.

Today we started with a stand up. Sarah showed what she organized on Trello. Lena was setting up the yaml. I spoke about how I reviewed module in fast api. I also brought out how I was struggling with git merges. We went over merges as a team and believe we are on the same page with commands. Once stand up was dome we whiteboarded out some models before we started to code and then moved onto some code. We were able to add some tables into traveltwo.sql. I worked on the review table and pushed that up to main.

Today we were able to present out wire frame to the class, I started off by explaining what Travel^2 is. My team filled in any question that werea sked.After was a slower start for me personally. My team worked on differnt things to try and move foward with the project. I went over some more fast api videos, specfically the one about creating models. It sure makes me wish Django was allowed to be used. Overall my team did well and progressed foward, creating a Trello workspace.

Today the team decided to review the Fast API exploration. I reread the exploration pages and went along with watching the videos. I believe the team will continue to review and prepare for tomorrows lecture. We plan on starting to code and build our website tomorrow once the API lecture is over.
